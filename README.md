*"Konrushi~! Uruha Rushia nanodesu!"*

Hang on- another rice? I swear I'm not doing this full time, I'm just bored during C*VID o k a y

I tried my best on i3 and tbh customizing was at least easier, though it was a pretty different experience from DWM that it took me weeks to grasp into it.

Real talk: DWM is faster-

Note that this rice is only tested on a laptop.
